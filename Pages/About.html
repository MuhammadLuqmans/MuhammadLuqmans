        Visited as a guest in the Echo restaurant for lunch just today. We were
        entertaining friends from California, and enjoyed our ocean side table.
        We chose to stay indoors - to enjoy the air conditioning ðŸ˜Š. I just want
        to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful waitress,
        Jackie. She had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency.
        She recognized that we wanted time to visit and did not rush us. She and
        other staff members made certain that we had everything we needed.
        Kudos!
